## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**QStarr-Inc/QStarr-Inc** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository!

My name is QStarr_Inc, and ill tell you all that I am doing!
So almost a month ago, on the 29th of august I started my journey by learning HTML, to understand the basics and develop my professional identity.
I'm still learning it, and putting it to the test, but now also combined with CSS and to add some flavour also JavaScript.
My goal for now is to make an awesome website in three months and an app in a year, wish me luck!

Fun fact, this all started because I finally decided to listen to myself!
